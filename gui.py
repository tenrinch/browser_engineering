     mainloop() starts the process of redrawing the screen.
     it enters a loop that looks similar to this:
     while True:
        for evt in pendingEvents():
        handleEvent(evt)
        drawScreen()
    
    The example event loop above may look like an infinite loop that locks up the computer, but itâ€™s not, because of preemptive multitasking among threads and processes and/or a variant of the event loop that sleeps unless it has inputs that wake it up from another thread or process.
